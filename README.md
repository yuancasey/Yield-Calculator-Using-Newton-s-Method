# Yield-Calculator-Using-Newton-s-Method
Newton’s method is a method to approximate solutions to an equation f(x) = 0 very quickly. It works by starting with a (more-or-less random) guess x0 for a solution, and then coming up with better and better approximations x1, x2, x3, etc., using the following process:
x1 = x0 − f(x0)/f′(x0) x2 = x1 − f(x1)/f′(x1) x3 = x2 − f(x2)/f′(x2)
and so on and so forth, with xn+1 = xn − f(xn)/f′(xn) in general. x1 will usually be close to a solution, and x2 will be closer, and x3 closer still, etc.
